1. Project work (group) - Setup own EC2

Step up an EC2 instance with your Spring Boot application. Expose endpoint and test it.

Follow the steps:

1. Create Spring Boot application:
- you can use Spring Initiallzr for that
- it should be using Java 17
- it should be using Maven
- add a Maven dependency: spring-boot-starter-web

2. Add rest controller with GET endpoint that will return a string (e.g. GET /helloAws)

3. Prepare the fat jar file with Maven using command: mvn clean install

4. Create new EC2 Instance in AWS console, choose free tier Linux machine with default settings.
E.g. Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type, t2.micro.
You should use default VPC, default Subnet, default Storage settings.
You can use existing, default Security Group, or create a new one - just remember what you chose.
When clicking "Launch" the creator will ask you about key pair. If you chose to create a new key pair, download it and remember where you store it - you won't be able to connect to your EC2 instance without it!

5. Modify Security Group that you selected/created in step 4. 
It can be found under Network and Security section in EC2 dashboard, on the left side bar. 
Allow inbound traffic from your computer IP by selecting type: "All Traffic" and Source: "My IP".

6. Copy jar file from your local machine to AWS EC2 using SCP (Mac, Linux) or SCP client (if you use Windows).

Set proper permissions to the key pair file:
chmod 400 yourkeypair.pem

Copy .jar file with your app to home directory of EC2 machine:
scp -i ./yourkeypair.pem ./yourApplicationName.jar ec2-user@yourPublicIPv4DNS:~

yourPublicIPv4DNS - You need to find it under Instance Details -> Public IPv4 DNS on EC2 Dashboard.

7. SSH into the EC2 instance and download and install Java 17. 

SSH:
ssh -i "yourkeypair.pem" ec2-user@yourPublicIPv4DNS

Download:
wget https://download.oracle.com/java/17/latest/jdk-17_linuxx64_bin.rpm

Install:
sudo rpm -Uvh jdk-17_linux-x64_bin.rpm

8. Run the Spring Boot application on EC2. 

So SSH to your machine -> run command: java -jar yourApplicationName.jar

Test your application by entering URL:

http://yourPublicIPv4DNS:8080/helloAws

Make sure it's HTTP (NOT https).

9. To make it work, allow inbound traffic on a port 8080 on your instance security group by selecting:
- type: "Custom TCP" 
- port range: "8080"
- source: "My IP"

10. Test your application again
